Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP 1.1:

Request Response method:
    Simple request response method which each request from the client resolve by the server in a linear fashion.
Header compression:
    It sends header as plaintext which can be redundant.
Binary protocol:
    It uses text based protocol,which is inefficient for parsing and processing.
Flow control:
    It doesn't have builtin flow control mechanism.

HTTP 2:

Request Response method:
    It uses multiplexing,so that multiple requests from client can be solved by the server in a parallel way over single connection.
Header compression:
    It uses header compression(HPACK)which reduces redundancy.
Binary protocol:
    It uses binary protocol which is more effcient for client and server.
Flow control:
    It includes flow control which the sender doesn't overwhelm the reciever with data.
