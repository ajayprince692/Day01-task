Read about IP address, port, HTTP methods, MAC address

IP address:(Internet Protocol Address)
    It is a unique name given to electronic gadgets like computer,mobile which participates in their network using Internet protocol for communication.
    It can either be IPv4(32 bit) or IPv6(128bit).
    It plays crucial role in routing data packets across Internet and local network.

Port:
    In networking port is a 16bit unsigned ineteger for specific function or service on a device within the network.
    They are used to distinguish services provided on the same device,for example HTTP uses port 80 where HTTPS uses port 443.

HTTP methods:

        Post- Used to add a data.
        Delete- Used to delete a data.
        Patch- Used to apply partial modifications to a resource.

MAC address:
    MAC address is a unique identifier which is given to networks,such as NICs(Network Interface Cards) and Ehternet ports on network devices.
    Unlike IP address they are hard coded into hardware of the device and are globally unique.
    They are used in OSI model of data to reduce the control flow of data within same local networks like ethernet.
