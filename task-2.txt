Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects:
    In javascript objects are composite datatypes that allows you to store and manipulate key-value pairs.Objects are one of the most fundamental and versatile datastructures in the language.They are used to represent the data in a organized and structured manner.
    Internal representation in Javascript consist of two parts:
        1. Data properties
        2. Accessor properties

    Data properties:
        It stores values,have attributes like,
            Value- actual data value.
            Writable- Boolean indicating whether value can be changed.
            Enumerable- Boolean indicating whether property can be enumerated in for in loops. 
            Configurable- Boolean indicating whether property's attributes can be changed and whether properties can be deleted.

    Accessor properties:
        It doesn't store values directly but define getter and setter functions for retrieving and setting values.
            Get- function to get the property Value.
            Set- function to set the property value.
            Enumerable and Configurable attributes like in Data properties.
